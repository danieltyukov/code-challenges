# 1. JavaScript test

Make a single page web application that uses an API from a movie catalog online database (we recommend https://www.omdbapi.com/).

This page must have a search feature and must list the top 3 matches by name, show the movie poster and link to the page when clicked on the poster.

Usage of libraries is recommended (i.e. Angular, React, Knockout, etc.).

Points for code elegance, modern trends, simplicity and efficiency.

Extra points for design.

Result must be a single html file, and should perform nothing more than the above requested.
