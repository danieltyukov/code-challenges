# 4. JavaScript test for web based back-end

Create a web based back-end service that serves calls for creating a beer collection.

This must allow the addition of a new beer, listing of all entries and searching an entry by any matching letters in the name.

The beer requires a name, type (i.e. Pale ale, Stout) and optionally a rating (1-5).
Also, a specific beer can have its rating updated, which does not overwrite but averages all ratings.

The service will be used in a client side JavaScript application that could be developed by another team, expecting the most efficient way to call these services.

Points awarded for code elegance, usage frameworks and particularly choice of technologies. (i.e. Web API, NodeJS)

Extra points for usage of advanced frameworks and clever re-factorization.

This test is optional if you did the 3rd test.
